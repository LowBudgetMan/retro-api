description: > 
  The Happy, Confused, Sad retro format is best used to drill down into specific feelings that team members have. By
  finding the root causes of these feelings and identifying things to try to stop/continue them, the team can start
  turning feelings into actions. Performing this retro often helps check to see if the small, actionable changes
  are having an impact on the emotions the team is feeling week over week.
  

  Happy: What made you feel happy? What could we do to continue that?
  
  Confused: What confused you? What can be done to help that confusion?
  
  Sad: What is something that saddened or angered you? How do we prevent that from happening again?
